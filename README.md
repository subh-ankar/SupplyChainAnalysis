# SkyLine Logistics: Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

**My Role:** Data Analyst, Global Operations

## 🛑 The Pain Point: Why I Built This

Before this project, SkyLine's sales and operations teams were essentially flying blind, piecing together insights from a stack of separate Excel sheets. This wasn't just slow—it made strategic decision-making impossible. We couldn't answer fundamental questions like:

* Are sales trending up or is it just noise?
* Which product lines are actually **making us money** (vs. just generating revenue)?
* How do our regional delivery delays bite into our final profit margin?

My goal was to shut down the spreadsheet chaos and deliver a single, undeniable source of truth.

## 🛠️ The Solution: Centralizing KPIs in Tableau

I built a core, interactive Tableau dashboard to integrate all crucial supply-chain and sales KPIs. This wasn't just about putting numbers on a screen; it was about connecting delivery performance directly to profit, which the teams couldn't do before.

### 🎯 Key Dashboard Views

The dashboard focuses on four views, all linked and filtered dynamically:

1.  **Sales Trend with Moving Average:** The raw monthly sales data was too volatile. I implemented a **3-Month Moving Average** to cut through the noise and show the executive team the *true* stable, upward trend we were actually riding.
2.  **Profit Margin by Category:** A stark comparison that immediately calls out the "busy work"—product categories that have high sales volume but abysmal profit margins. This drives action.
3.  **Profit vs. Delivery Performance:** This is the most crucial view. It’s a scatter plot that proves the business case: **where average delivery days are high, profit per market is low.** It visually flags markets that need urgent operational review.
4.  **Regional KPI Summary:** A quick-glance card summarizing Sales, Profit Margin %, and Avg. Delivery Days—the fastest way for a manager to check the pulse of their region.

## Key Insights Delivered

The dashboard provided immediate, actionable findings that empowered specific, targeted decisions:

### 1️⃣ Delivery Performance
* Late deliveries were **strongly correlated with specific shipping modes and regions**, allowing logistics to focus their efforts.
* The **“Standard Class”** shipping mode accounted for the highest delay risk.
* We were able to pinpoint **specific states/regions** that consistently underperformed in delivery times.

### 2️⃣ Market-Level Profitability
* **APAC and Europe** were confirmed as the highest profit-per-order markets.
* **LATAM** showed strong sales volume but shockingly low margins, clearly signaling a need for a deep dive into cost inefficiencies or pricing strategy in that region.

### 3️⃣ Product Category Margin Analysis
* **Technology and Office Supplies** delivered the strongest, most reliable profit margins.
* We identified certain product sub-categories that drove **negative margins** due to excessive discounting, prompting a review of the sales team's promo strategy.

### 4️⃣ Monthly Revenue Trend
* The analysis confirmed **strong seasonality** in our revenue cycle, allowing for better inventory planning.
* The 3-month moving average was essential for **smoothing volatility** and providing stable, confident reporting to the executive team.

## Impact on the Business

This project was more than just a reporting change; it changed *how* the teams worked.

* **Decision-Making Confidence:** Sales and Ops now use the same numbers, eliminating arguments over whose spreadsheet is "right."
* **Faster Cycles:** Month-end review meetings now focus on *strategy* (Why did this market underperform?) rather than *data compilation* (Where do I find the data?).
* **Single Source of Truth:** We retired several manual reports, streamlining our entire reporting infrastructure.
