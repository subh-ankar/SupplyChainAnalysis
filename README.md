📦 Supply Chain Performance Dashboard
SkyLine Logistics – Global Operations
Role: Data Analyst, Supply Chain
Overview

SkyLine Logistics manages multi-region distribution for several product lines.
Before this project, sales and operations teams were relying on separate spreadsheets, which made it difficult to understand:

How sales were trending month to month

Which product categories were actually profitable

How delivery performance differed by region

Where operational delays were affecting margin

To address this, I built an integrated Tableau dashboard that centralizes the most important supply-chain KPIs in one place.

Project Goals

The dashboard was designed to help regional and operations managers:

Track monthly sales performance with clear trend indicators

Compare profit margins across product categories

Understand how delivery times influence profit

Quickly evaluate KPIs across markets without switching tools

Dashboard Contents
1. Monthly Sales Trend (with 3-Month Moving Average)

Shows monthly sales volume and smooths fluctuations with a moving average.
This view makes it easier to spot seasonal patterns and identify growth or decline periods.

2. Profit Margin by Product Category

Highlights which categories contribute the most to margin and which ones need review due to low profitability.

3. Profit vs Delivery Performance (Market Comparison)

Scatter plot comparing:

Average delivery days

Profit per market

Useful for flagging markets where delays are impacting profitability.

4. Regional KPI Summary

Quick view of:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Profit Margin %

Average Delivery Days

Filters are synced across all visuals for a consistent view.

Tools Used

Tableau for dashboard build and KPI visualization

Excel for initial data preparation

SQL for cleaning and aggregating data

Insights

A few takeaways that were surfaced through the dashboard:

The moving average revealed a stable upward trend that wasn’t visible in the raw monthly data.

Markets with faster delivery times generally posted stronger margins.

A couple of product categories generated strong sales but weak margins, suggesting operational review.

Some markets consistently underperformed in delivery SLAs, which aligned with lower profitability.

Impact

The dashboard replaced several manual reports and provided a single source of information for both sales and operations.
Teams now have:

Faster month-end review cycles

Clearer visibility into performance gaps

More confident decision-making around inventory and logistics

Better-quality conversations during regional reviews
